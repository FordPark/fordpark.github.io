A [New Yorker article](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/01/30/groupthink) on the history of brainstorming from 1940s Madison Avenue advertising firms to Steve Jobs planning the layout of Pixar’s new headquarters:

>Jobs soon realized that it wasn’t enough simply to create an airy atrium; he needed to force people to go there. He began with the mailboxes, which he shifted to the lobby. Then he moved the meeting rooms to the center of the building, followed by the cafeteria, the coffee bar, and the gift shop. Finally, he decided that the atrium should contain the only set of bathrooms in the entire building ... He really believed that the best meetings happened by accident, in the hallway or parking lot.
