An [NYT article](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/06/opinion/sunday/adam-grant-friends-at-work-not-so-much.html) on interactions in the workplace.

>We may start companies with our friends, but we don’t become friends with our co-workers. “We are not only ‘[bowling alone](http://www.amazon.com/Bowling-Alone-Collapse-American-Community/dp/0743203046),’ ” Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor at Stanford, observes, “we are increasingly ‘working alone.’ ”

>What will make workplaces less transactional? Research suggests that social events aren’t always effective: People don’t mix much at mixers, and at company parties, they mostly bond with similar colleagues.
