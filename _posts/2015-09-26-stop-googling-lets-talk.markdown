An [NYT article](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/27/opinion/sunday/stop-googling-lets-talk.html) on "what has happened to face-to-face conversation in a world where so many people say they would rather text than talk."

>The “app generation” grew up with phones in hand and apps at the ready. It tends toward impatience, expecting the world to respond like an app, quickly and efficiently.
