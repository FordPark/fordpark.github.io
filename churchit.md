**IT wise.  In the UK**.  We're talking here about a city centre church with with at least 10 staff and a congregation of 500.  Nowadays all a church needs is gmail, dropbox and twitter but to flesh out the details:

- Website - a [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) responsive site which points people to your google calendar and twitter.  Don't use joomla or wordpress as a)  after the initial excitement, no one will want to write articles for the website and b) at some point an update will break your expensive theme. Use a professional photographer - no one goes to websites anymore, but if they do, they just look at the pictures.  Because you're using google calendar twitter (see below) to keep people informed you're looking at a website which changes very rarely eg when there is a new staff member.

- Online articles - a [jekyll blog](https://jekyllrb.com).  And yes it's responsive.

- Email - [google apps gmail](https://apps.google.com/products/gmail/).

- Public calendar - [google apps calendar](https://apps.google.com/products/calendar/).  Make people subscribe to it rather than displaying it via a pretty webpage which usually isn't that pretty.  

- Dropbox - people love it.

- Audio hosting and feed - [libsyn](https://www.libsyn.com/plans-pricing/), [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/pro?ref=t201).

- Updates/photos - twitter.

- Event/conference registration - [wufoo](https://www.wufoo.com), [eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk).

- Printer support contract - [Konica Minolta](http://www.konicaminolta.co.uk/business-solutions/home.html).  It might be just a coincidence but every organisation I've worked for, used Konica and I've always been impressed with their level of service.

- AV support contract - get one.  And don't leave it to the last minute as it takes time - finding a good av firm who will support a system they haven't installed can be tricky and if you do manage to find one, they will want to do an audit.  The best I've worked with are [d3](http://www.d3av.co.uk/1/1/Home/Home.html).

- NAS - get an inexpensive 1 or 2 bay [synology](https://www.synology.com/en-uk/) or [qnap](https://www.qnap.com/i/uk/).  This is mainly for the av team to park their large files.  [Chronosync](http://www.econtechnologies.com/chronosync/overview.html) to backup up once a week to external drives, always have one drive off site.

Anything outside of the above means you're going down the bespoke route and you have to be really sure the gains are worth it, as it means an increased support burden.

With the above setup requiring minimal IT support, the most important tech person onsite is the head of the av team - you want them to be hands-on as this helps problem solving when the av engineers turn up.
