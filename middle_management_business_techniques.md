Go into any church in the UK which is desperately trying to be with it and you will be hit with middle management powerpoint presentations like it was still the 90s.  Or a trendy dotcom company powerpoint presentation.  From the 90s.

Being in charge of a sound team at a church, people assumed I thought the more av, the better.  In fact, I think it is a distraction, particularly if used during a sermon.  So when Tim Keller did a [Q&A on twitter](https://twitter.com/RyanCole4/status/604703144887656449) in 2015 about preaching (he had just written a book on the subject), the following made me smile:

>What’s your view on showing film clips, playing songs, and using other visual/audio from pop culture to help prove a point?

>I don’t do that. I think good preaching creates the images in the mind and pricks the imagination a la Jonathan Edwards.

Quite.
